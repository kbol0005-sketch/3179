          <p>Australia’s domestic air network connects key hubs such as Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane with regional destinations across the country. The visualisation below integrates an interactive map and route-level passenger trends to illustrate how traffic volumes have evolved between 2019 and 2024. We focus on comparing these two years as representative pre- and post-pandemic benchmarks, since the early post-pandemic period (2021–2023) remained distorted by gradual reopenings, capacity constraints, and uneven demand recovery.</p>
          <p>While most domestic routes experienced passenger changes within a normal range, some major corridors showed pronounced swings of up to ±30%. These substantial increases and decreases highlight how travel behaviour shifted in the wake of the pandemic patterns that readers can explore further using the interactive filters and traffic-change categories below.</p>

          <p>The chart above visualises annual passenger traffic at Australia’s major airports between 2015 and 2024. It highlights the sharp decline during the pandemic years, followed by a steady recovery across most airports. Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane have now returned to near pre-pandemic levels, while smaller airports such as Hobart and Canberra show slower but consistent growth. This trend reflects the broader rebound of domestic tourism and business travel across the country.</p>
