        <p>Australia’s domestic air network connects key hubs such as Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane with regional destinations across the country. The visualisation integrates an interactive route map and passenger-traffic timeline to show how connectivity evolved between 2019 and 2024, chosen as representative pre- and post-pandemic benchmarks. The intervening years (2021–2023) were shaped by gradual reopenings, aircraft-capacity limits, and uneven demand recovery across states and markets.</p>
        <p>The map uses line thickness to represent total passenger volumes on each route, while colour indicates the percentage change in traffic relative to 2019. This visualisation highlights contrasting recovery trajectories across Australia’s air corridors. Intercapital routes such as Sydney–Melbourne, Sydney–Canberra, and Sydney–Brisbance continue to operate below 2019 levels, reflecting the slower return of corporate and government travel. This downturn was further amplified by structural changes in business behaviour, including the widespread adoption of remote meetings, hybrid workplaces, and digital administrative processes, which have permanently reduced the need for short-haul business flights.</p>
        <p>In contrast, regional and leisure-oriented routes have rebounded strongly, driven by a surge in domestic tourism and lifestyle-related travel. Notably, passenger traffic along the Adelaide–Gold Coast and Brisbane–Hobart routes rose by nearly 30 % compared with 2019, underscoring how Australians redirected travel spending toward holiday destinations and interstate leisure trips in the post-pandemic era.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The interactive bar chart below the map allows users to explore route-specific trends across the past decade, revealing the sharp collapse of 2020 and the gradual recovery that followed. Together, these visuals provide a clear view of how Australia’s aviation network has adjusted, recovering much of its capacity while evolving toward new travel patterns, purposes, and regional dynamics.</p>

          <p>The chart below illustrates the evolution of Australia’s domestic aviation activity over the past decade. Aircraft trips and passenger volumes grew steadily until 2019, before collapsing in 2020 as nationwide lockdowns and border closures grounded most flights. At the height of the restrictions, passenger traffic fell by roughly 70 % compared with 2019 levels. From 2021 onward, both flight frequency and passenger demand rebounded strongly as travel restrictions eased, though the recovery trajectory remained uneven across states and carriers. By 2024, domestic passenger traffic and flight activity have nearly returned to their 2019 levels, but still remain below pre-pandemic conditions.</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">From a basic economic perspective, the two series can be viewed as demand and supply indicators within the domestic aviation market. Passenger traffic reflects demand for air travel, while aircraft trips represent the supply of flight capacity. The close alignment between the two before 2020 suggests a stable balance between capacity and utilisation. The sharp simultaneous decline in 2020 illustrates a shock that constrained both sides of the market, while the parallel recovery after 2021 shows airlines adjusting supply in response to rising demand as domestic mobility and tourism resumed.</p>

         <p>While passenger traffic and aircraft trips can broadly be viewed as demand and supply indicators, they are not precise measures of either. For instance, 1,000 passengers flying between Melbourne and Sydney (a short domestic route) do not represent the same level of demand as 1,000 passengers flying between Sydney and Perth, which covers nearly four times the distance and requires far more aircraft resources. Similarly, counting the number of flights alone does not reveal how much seating capacity was offered or utilised. These limitations highlight why passenger numbers and aircraft movements, while intuitive, provide only a simplified view of aviation activity.</p>
         <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The chart below provides a more refined perspective by showing Available Seat Kilometres (ASK) and Load Factor (LF), the industry’s standard measures of capacity and utilisation. The stacked bars represent the total ASK, divided into used and unused capacity: the darker section shows kilometres flown with paying passengers (used ASK), while the lighter section indicates empty capacity (unused ASK). The line over the bars shows the Load Factor, or the proportion of available seat-kilometres that were actually occupied. Both ASK and Load Factor declined sharply in 2020, reflecting not only the drastic reduction in flight operations but also passenger-spacing requirements, as airlines were compelled to operate at lower seat occupancy to comply with health and distancing rules. From 2021 onwards, ASK expanded as airlines reintroduced flights, while Load Factor improved gradually as social-distancing restrictions were lifted and passenger demand recovered.</p>

         <p>The chart below highlights the uneven recovery in domestic passenger traffic across Australia’s major airports from 2015 to 2024. Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane consistently handled the highest passenger volumes throughout the period, reflecting their dominance as national aviation hubs. The pandemic caused a dramatic collapse across all airports in 2020, with traffic falling by more than two-thirds as state borders closed and domestic travel was severely restricted.</p>
         <p tyle="margin-bottom: 0;">While passenger numbers rebounded sharply from 2021 onward, most major hubs have yet to fully return to their 2019 traffic levels. The recovery pace varied by region: airports in states with earlier border reopenings, such as Perth and Brisbane, regained traffic more quickly, while Melbourne and Sydney lagged slightly due to longer lockdowns and international flight dependencies. Smaller regional airports such as Cairns, Gold Coast, and Hobart saw steadier recoveries supported by intrastate tourism. Overall, the data illustrate how the rebound in air travel, though strong, remains geographically imbalanced, with Australia’s key gateways still operating below their pre-pandemic throughput.</p>
